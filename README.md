# Selfprof-Use-Case
 Use Case for Selfprof PHP Developer

This case is a phone directory.
You can add a new phone number that is associated with a name, list your registered numbers, delete or update any listed number.

The backend is done by PHP and requests are sent with ajax. 

For Frontend, js libraries that I used are:
-sweetalert2 https://sweetalert2.github.io/, for the popup alert when trying to delete a phone number.
-toastr https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr  for displaying toast notification prompts when needed,
-libphonenumber https://github.com/google/libphonenumber  for visually formatting the input box like a international Turkish phone number.
