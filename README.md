# Selfprof-Use-Case
 Use Case for Selfprof PHP Developer

This case is a phone directory.
You can add a new phone number that is associated with a name, list your registered numbers, delete or update any listed number.

The backend is done by PHP and requests are sent with ajax. 

Js libraries that I used for frontend are: <br>
-sweetalert2 https://sweetalert2.github.io/, for the popup alert when trying to delete a phone number.<br>
-toastr https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr  for displaying toast notification prompts when needed,<br>
-libphonenumber https://github.com/google/libphonenumber  for visually formatting the input box like a international Turkish phone number.
